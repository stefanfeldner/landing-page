# Landing Page
A landing page with a dynamically generated Navigation based on the content of the page.

Sections and Menu Items get highlighted when scrolled into the viewport.
I also added a button to move the user up the page that only appears after scrolling.

Build as an exercise for the Udacity Front End Nanodegree.
